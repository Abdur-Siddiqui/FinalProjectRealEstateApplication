# FinalProjectRealEstateApplication
I am creating the backend for my real Estate Application, the purpose of this applcation is to allow users to be able to view a lisitng for a house or condo and 
view a booking id. 

Unfortuanlty I ran into some errors, such as my database was not working, it wasnt showing, the post, get, delete requests were not working.
I tried using post man, to create a post request, but I kept getting an error, and cold nto figure it out.
